* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem**
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps**
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** if possible
* **Include device information** (iPhone model, iOS version)
* **Include crash logs** if applicable

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead**
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing code style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrejnesterov/UNetVisualizerKit.git
cd UNetVisualizerKit
```

2. Open in Xcode:
```bash
open Package.swift
```

3. Build and test:
```bash
swift build
swift test
```

### Code Style

* Use Swift's standard naming conventions
* Follow the existing code formatting
* Add documentation comments for public APIs
* Keep functions focused and small
* Write self-documenting code

Example:
```swift
/// Processes the input image and returns visualization result
/// - Parameters:
///   - image: The input image to process
/// - Returns: The visualization result containing prediction and performance metrics
/// - Throws: `ModelError` if processing fails
public func process(_ image: CGImage) async throws -> VisualizationResult {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Maintain or improve code coverage
* Test on multiple device types when possible
* Include performance tests for critical paths

### Documentation

* Update README.md if you change functionality
* Add inline documentation for public APIs
* Update tutorials if adding new features
* Include code examples in documentation
